This online document helps the absolute beginners to persue the future direction in coding and machine learning. The lesson starts with how to write code in Python along with fundamental ideas in data structure, function and class, Numpy, Pandas and some projects in Machine Learning (Linear Model, Classifiers e.g., Logistic regression, trees, svm, ensamble).
